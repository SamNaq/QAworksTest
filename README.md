## Highlights 
#The test initially only required to navigate till the contact us page.
# I have further taken this test till the submission of 'Get in Touch' form. 
# I could not put an Assertion in the last step i.e. after the submission of the form since the form is 
# giving an error when user clicks Submit. Hence I do not know what the confirmation message of submission would
# be to apply an assertion.
